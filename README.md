## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The objective of this project is ...

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will enable you to ...
This is a pipeline that was written initially in shell scripts that call different software and in few python and R scripts.
It is currently in the process to be coded as a nextflow metagenomics workflow.

## üîß Prerequisites and installing <a name = "prerequisites_and_installing"></a>
This workflow is set up to be executed on ...
Therefore, the only prerequisite is to have ...

1. Install dependencies into isolated environment
```
conda env create --name your_conda_name --file file.yaml
```
2. Activate environment
```
source activate imp_proj
```

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
1. Quick QC check of the raw sequenced data (fastQC)
2. quality control of metagenomic data, meant for microbiome experiments (Kneaddata)
3. Assembly of the reads (MegaHit): per sample and coassembly (step previous to Anvi'o)
4. Kingdom distribution: Prediction of whether a contig is eukaryotic or prokaryotic   
5. Taxonomical and functional annotation of the contigs (Anvi'o tools)
6. Mapping high-quality reads to the contigs (within Anvi'o framework)
7. Taxonomical annotation and taxa abundance estimation based on reference genomes (Metaphlan 4.0)

## üß¨ Bioinformatic parameters <a name = "deployment"></a>
Following, the parameters included in the nextflow pipeline (file --> nextflow_orange.nf)

1. FASTQC
short description: tool designed for the quality control analysis og high-throughput sequencing data reporting visualizations that help assess the quality and 
characteristics of sequencing data before downstream analysis <br>

-o (--output) = specifies the output directory to store the processed data <br>
-q = ? <br>

2. KNEADDATA
<<<<<<< HEAD
short description: tool used for QC and pre-processing of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data;we need to consider we are working with input paired-end 
sequences files. <br>

-i1 = specifies the path to the input file containing the forward (R1) reads. <br>
-i2 = specifies the path to the input file containing the reverse (R2) reads. <br>
--reference-db = specifies the reference database or databases to be used for contaminant removal (host genomes, known contaminants, etc...) <br>
--output = specifies the output directory to store the processed data <br>
--bypass-trim = skip the trimming step during the processing of sequencing data (either already trimmed or not required) <br>

3. MEGAHIT
short description: metagenome assembly tool used for assembling seqeuncing data particularly obtained from high-throughput sequencing technologies <br>

-1 = specifies the path to the input file containing the first pair of paired-end reads <br>
-2 = specifies the path to the input file containing the second pair of paired-end reads <br>
-o = specifies the output directory to store the assembled contigs or output files <br>

4. WHOKARYOTE
short description: https://github.com/LottePronk/whokaryote; this tool uses random forest to rpedict wheter a contig is from eukaryote or from a prokaryote <br>

--contigs = specifies the path with your contigs file <br>
--minsize = specifies a minimum contig size in bp, by default is 5000 (accuracy on contigs below 5000 is lower) <br>
--outdir = specifies the output directory to store the output file <br>

5. METAPHLAN
short description: tool used for taxonomic profiling of metagenomic sequencing data (used for identification and quantification of microbial species present in a 
given sample based on unique clade-specific marker genes) <br>

-t = specifies the taxonomic level for the output; it allows users to choose the level of taxonomic resolution for the results <br>
--bowtie2out = specifies the output file for Bowtie2 alignments generated --> it is used internally by MetaPhlAn for read alignments against the marker gene database. This parameter allows users to specify the file path where the Bowtie2 alignment results will be stored <br>
--input_type = specifies the input data type for MetaPhlAn. It allows users to inform MetaPhlAn about the type of input data being provided (fastq, sam, bam) <br>
