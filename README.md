## About <a name = "about"></a>
The repository presents a comprehensive workflow for metagenomic analysis, starting from an initial assessment of data quality to an 
in-depth understanding of the composition and function of the examined microbiome. The analysis begins with a quality check of the 
sequenced data using FastQC, followed by a specific quality control for metagenomic data with Kneaddata. Subsequently, the workflow 
proceeds to the assembly of the reads with MegaHit and the classification of contigs into eukaryotic or prokaryotic. Anvi'o is then 
employed for the taxonomic and functional annotation of the contigs, as well as for mapping high-quality reads. Finally, Metaphlan 4.0 
facilitates further taxonomic annotation and the estimation of the abundance of various species based on reference genomes, thus 
completing the comprehensive analysis of the microbiome.

## Getting started <a name = "getting-started"></a>
These instructions will enable you to ...
This is a pipeline that was written initially in shell scripts that call different software and in few python and R scripts.
It is currently in the process to be coded as a nextflow metagenomics workflow.

## Prerequisites and installing <a name = "prerequisites-and-installing"></a>
This workflow is set up to be executed on ...
Therefore, the only prerequisite is to have ...

1. Install dependencies into isolated environment
```
conda env create --name your_conda_name --file file.yaml
```
2. Activate environment
```
source activate imp_proj
```

## Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
1. Quick QC check of the raw sequenced data (fastQC)
2. quality control of metagenomic data, meant for microbiome experiments (Kneaddata)
3. Assembly of the reads (MegaHit): per sample and coassembly (step previous to Anvi'o)
4. Kingdom distribution: Prediction of whether a contig is eukaryotic or prokaryotic   
5. Taxonomical and functional annotation of the contigs (Anvi'o tools)
6. Mapping high-quality reads to the contigs (within Anvi'o framework)
7. Taxonomical annotation and taxa abundance estimation based on reference genomes (Metaphlan 4.0)
